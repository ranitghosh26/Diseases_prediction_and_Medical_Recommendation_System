     <h3> About Us</h3>

<p>
Welcome to <strong>Medical Health Center</strong> — a student-driven innovation from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).
We believe that technology and healthcare together can create a brighter, healthier future. <br>
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:#0077cc;">We care for you.</span>
</p>

<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>
We envision a world where access to healthcare information is simple, smart, and available to everyone.
Our goal is to empower people to understand their health better using modern technology.
</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>
We are a group of passionate CSE students who share a common mission — to combine data science, artificial intelligence, and web development to make healthcare more accessible and informative.
This project represents our teamwork, creativity, and commitment to innovation in the healthcare domain.
</p>

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>
Our mission is to provide an intelligent platform that predicts potential health conditions from user-reported symptoms.
Using AI and machine learning, we aim to guide users toward better awareness and informed health decisions.
</p>

<h3>How We Do It</h3>
<p>
Our system is powered by a trained machine learning model that analyzes symptom data and suggests possible diseases.
It also provides helpful resources including disease descriptions, precautions, medications, diets, and workouts to encourage a healthy lifestyle.
</p>

<h3>Your Well-being, Our Priority</h3>
<p>
We believe that technology should serve humanity.
That’s why this platform is designed to educate, inform, and assist users — not replace medical professionals.
It’s a digital companion that supports your health journey with useful insights.
</p>

<h3>Join Us on This Journey</h3>
<p>
As students, this project marks a step toward our dream of using technology for social good.
We invite you to explore, learn, and experience how computer science can transform healthcare.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for visiting <strong>Medical Health Center</strong> — a student innovation where technology meets care.
