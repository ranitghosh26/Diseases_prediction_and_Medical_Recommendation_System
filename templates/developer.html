<h6>    About Us: Your AI & ML Engineers
</h6>
<h5>Meet the Developers</h5>
<p>Hello! We are <b>Barnali Manna</b>, <b>Ranit Ghosh</b>, and <b>Kushal Ghara</b> — Computer Science Engineering students who developed this project as part of our academic learning journey. Our shared passion for technology, healthcare, and innovation inspired us to build this Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web Application using Flask and Machine Learning.</p>

<h5>Our Expertise</h5>
<p>As CSE students, we have explored various areas of computer science including web development, data science, and machine learning. Through this project, we applied our classroom knowledge to a real-world problem — creating an intelligent, user-friendly platform capable of predicting diseases based on symptoms. This project gave us practical experience in Python, Flask, data preprocessing, and machine learning model deployment.</p>

<h5>Our Commitment</h5>
<p>Our work is guided by a commitment to innovation, teamwork, and a belief that technology can make healthcare more accessible. We focused on designing a solution that is both technically sound and user-centric, ensuring that users can interact with the system easily while getting meaningful results.</p>

<h5>Passion for Health Tech</h5>
<p>The development of the <b>Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App</b> represents our dedication to applying AI and ML concepts to real-world healthcare challenges. We believe that artificial intelligence has the power to transform healthcare by providing accurate, personalized, and easily accessible information.</p>

<h5>Join Us on this Journey</h5>
<p>We invite you to explore our project and experience how technology and healthcare can work together. This project reflects our learning, creativity, and teamwork as CSE students — and we hope it inspires others to use technology for positive social impact.</p>
